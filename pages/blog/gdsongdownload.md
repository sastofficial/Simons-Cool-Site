## I made a song downloader for GD
So i got corona and i was bored so i messed around with get requests and python and made a program that downloads songs from geometry dash.
It uses the [Geometry Dash Level Browser API](https://gdbrowser.com/api) made by [Colon](https://gdcolon.com/). 
And the [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) module for [Python](https://www.python.org/).
You can download it at [https://sastofficial.github.io/pages/gd-song-downloader](https://sastofficial.github.io/pages/gd-song-downloader)
Anyways i dont have corona anymore and i am at school writing this.
### BYE :)
